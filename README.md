### Continued development

I developed this website using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. I'm using Bootstrap. Firstly, I created the navbar and hero section, followed by the features and newsletter, and finally the footer.


### Useful resources

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/getting-started/introduction/) - This is an amazing docs which helped me finally understand bootstrap. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept with Bootstrap, the worldâ€™s most popular framework for building responsive, mobile-first sites.
